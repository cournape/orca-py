orca-py is a tentative port of [Orca](https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/orca), the
esoteric programming language for music livecoding, to python.

This project is not meant to be usable, it is mostly a way to learn more about
orca in python, a language I am familiar  with. The long term goal is to
understand enough about orca to port it to programming languages I want to
learn, such as rust or golang.
